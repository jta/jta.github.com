I make dumb switches do clever things at [fastly](www.fastly.com).

In addition to writing software for network orchestration, I work on protocol design and performance. This involves a lot of time looking at packets, and a lot more trying to find where they went instead.

Formerly a postgrad, researcher, gaijin, <strike>cynic</strike>.
